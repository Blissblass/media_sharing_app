# Welcome!

This is a song sharing app built with React as the frontend client and Ruby On Rails for the backend!

It uses polymorphic associations to handle likes and uses devise for authentication using JSON calls between the frontend and backend.
This project also uses instantenous flash messages that clearly communicate errors that might happen during login/signup to the user.

This project uses these npm packages and RoR gems:
 1. NPM Packages:
  * React (Obviously)
  * Bootstrap
  * React-Bootstrap to fix some code conflicts
  * React Router and React Router Dom to create a SPA (Single Page Application)
  * React Icons to make displaying FA icons and alike easier

 2. Ruby On Rails Gems:
  * Devise to handle user authentication
  * Sqlite3 for development, will switch to Psql in the future

This project also uses ActiveStorage to handle uploading and fetching media.
